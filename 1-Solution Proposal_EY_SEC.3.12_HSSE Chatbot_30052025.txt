1. Purpose of Document

The document is required to establish a common understanding of the objectives and consolidate the information known at this time about the business processes.  The document will provide the framework and the requirements for the further development of the digital solution at various levels to ensure the final output satisfies the long-term roadmap for the business.  It focuses on the capabilities/functionalities needed by the stakeholders and users and why these needs exist. 

2. Solution Overview 
2.1. Background
? Health and Safety department of SEC is overwhelmed with a high volume of manual queries regarding the safety management system.  
? Presently, there is a lack of structured and formal methods for disseminating HSSE knowledge. Additionally, issues such as data inaccuracy and delayed responses to stakeholder inquiries make the process inefficient.    
? No digital automation is currently available to handle topics related to the HSSE safety management system. Queries are currently addressed through traditional methods like emails, phone calls, and in-person meetings. These queries are not recorded nor analyzed in any structured manner.   
? The proposed solution is to develop a chatbot that can provide employees with information and knowledge about safety-related topics, particularly focusing on safety management system (procedures, standards, etc.). This solution will be accessible through mobile applications.  
2.2. Automation opportunities
? Automating requests for Health-and-safety – related topics 
? Automating responses for Health-and-safety – related topics, based on ISMS Standards documentation and AMAN (Enablon) Health-and-safety management system 
2.3. Business objectives and success/acceptance criteria
The business objectives for this solution include: 
? Providing real time answers on HSSE topics to stakeholders    
? Providing mobility options i.e. access to?Chatbot via a web application 
? Providing a formal communication gateway for safety knowledge and information    
? Enhancing safety knowledge and culture in SEC    
? Minimizing delays and currently time-consuming process of answering questions and inquiries 






3. Back-end Architecture

3.1. High level architecture
The following Design Decisions have been made for the implementation of the H&S Chatbot: 
* Translation service (only in option 3): dependency on IBM to deliver support for Arabic in Watsonx Discovery  
* Designing detailed conversation flows for each dialog, including user inputs and chatbot responses, is not required, as generative AI will respond and adapt dynamically.
* The system is designed to be extendable for future enhancements allowing connection to external international standards libraries
* Multiple Large Language Models can be used to support the requirements.


Component Options Recommendation Justification Deployment * Cloud 
* On premise On premise Required by SEC, explicitly stated in the SoW Assistant connection * Native (only small models, less customization, no Arabic language),

* API Standards – it is assumed that the standard ODATA API is used for Enablon. If not, the scope of this project may need to be adjusted 

9.3. Dependencies
The successful delivery of the HSSE Chatbot solution is dependent on several key factors: 
* The build will only start once EY Team has received all the required accesses. Specifically, this includes:
- SEC ID
- Configured watsonx according to the requirements
- SSO enabled to test chatbot access
- Access to ISMS
- Access to Enablon
- Access to the VM and SEC infrastructure
* The build will only start once the GPUs (Graphic Processing Units) are available as they are required for the system to function properly and ensure optimal performance.
* Availability of the watsonx Technology: The watsonx technology must be available and operational within the SEC environment. This includes ensuring that the necessary hardware and software infrastructure is in place and functioning correctly.
